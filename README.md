# Basic-cryptography: AES Square attack C++
Square attack on 5-round AES and testing different exponentiation methods

I searched online and could not find a single implementation of the AES Square Attack (there is one for 4-round
using python, but none for 5-round version). 
So here it is. 5-round AES Square Attack, C++, no extra library. It can be done in C easily, just a bit longer.
Comments are put (mostly) everywhere.

Idea based on this: https://www.davidwong.fr/blockbreakers/index.html
